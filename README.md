# Stock Data Downloader

## Project Overview
The Stock Data Downloader is a Python-based tool designed to facilitate the easy downloading and archiving of historical stock data. Utilizing the `yfinance` library, this application fetches stock price data over a specified date range and compresses the data into a ZIP file for convenient download and storage.

## Key Features
- **Data Upload**: Users can upload a CSV file containing stock symbols (with the header 'SYMBOL') to specify which stocks they wish to download data for.
- **Historical Data Download**: The application fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance for the past year or a user-specified range.
- **Data Compression**: Downloaded data is automatically compressed into a ZIP file, making it easy to manage and transfer.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit, the application offers a simple, interactive interface that requires no prior technical knowledge to navigate.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used.
- **Streamlit**: For creating the web-based user interface.
- **yfinance**: Used to fetch stock price data.
- **Pandas**: For handling data manipulation tasks.
- **Zipfile**: Integrated for compressing the downloaded data into ZIP format.
